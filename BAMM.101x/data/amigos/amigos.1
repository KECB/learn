I see all these bad reviews, but speaking for myself, I've never gotten bad service here, or had a negative experience in the least--and I'm here about once a week.

The atmosphere is fun and laid back, but not in a divey way. I've never had a bad dish, although some are merely average; however, a few are A+: THE QUESADILLAS, the Queso Fundido, and the margaritas are among the best I've ever had. The guacamole is above average.

Also, they have really great specials during the week--I believe one day is something like $21.95 for unlimited quesadillas + 5 margaritas? That sounds so impossible even as I type it but I'm pretty sure that's correct
