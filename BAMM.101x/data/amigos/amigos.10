My friend and I decided to go out on Cinco de Mayo but we wanted something close to home with a nice vibe, people and good music and food. I remember a friend telling me about this place a while back. So I decided to make a reservation.  Not only did we get there and find that it was packed BUT the receptionist explained that since we did make reservations,  we were priority on the list. 

We found some seats at the bar and got some drinks. No more than 20 minutes later were we seated. The staff was great,  the food was great,  the drinks were AMAZING! The music was beautiful and the vibe was on point. 

I will DEFINITELY be going back with even more people! I love it!
