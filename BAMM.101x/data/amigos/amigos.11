We stopped at Amigos while walking the length of Broadway (yes, all 13 miles of it) and were craving a quick bite for lunch. It's located on a cute and busy strip along Broadway, not far from Bank Street and a few doors down from the Seinfeld famous Tom's Restaurant.  

They had both sidewalk and indoor seating available when we visited. We opted for indoor near the window. Service was prompt and courteous while we were here--no complaints at all. They provide complimentary chips and salsa which is always a pro.

The menu is ample--for both food and drink options. Definitely a TON of specials (each day has a different food special, brunch specials on the weekends, $3 margaritas during the day). Definitely a place you can get a great bang for your buck.

We both opted for quesadillas (shrimp and chicken) and were surprised to see it came with three medium sized quesadillas, along with sides of rice and beans. Huge portion! Quality was average I'd say, we were satisfied but not blown away. Would definitely come here again for happy hour specials though--looked like a fun spot!
