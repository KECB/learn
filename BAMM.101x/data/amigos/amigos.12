Yeah what a terrible place. The waiter hated us from the second we walked in. We had to ask no less than 5 times over the course of our meal for water refills, at least 3 for more chips, and I had to go get the check myself. Possibly the most blas√© service I have had ever, but at least in the last long time. 

The food was decent, though, which is surprising considering the horrific service. My shrimp enchiladas had a good flavor if they were drenched in oil. Guac was good and you can customize the spiciness and ingredients. The spicy margarita was really top notch, and at $11 I've gotten to the point where I think that's a fair price for a cocktail.

When I went to retrieve the check since we had been sitting for a good 20 minutes, I told the manager what a terrible experience we had. He was like, "Oh, I'm so sorry, service is top notch, I'm so sorry, please come back and see us again" asking for my name and stuff. Yeah I mean I won't be back because I don't live in NY but I would never go back anyway.
