After walking around the area, we decided to give this place a try. We had a choice of either sitting at the booths or sitting near the bar. We opted to sit near the bar and was immediately seated. The back of the restaurant and the restaurant looked a little sketchy. Daughter ordered the Arroz Con Pollo and thought it was a bit bland. It tasted like Chicken Fried Rice. Hubs ordered the Tilapia Tacos and thought it was pretty good. I liked the fact that the tilapia was fried and the fish wasn't overcooked. I ordered the Enchilada with Salsa Verde and it was spicy and pretty good. Daughter ended up eating my order because it was tastier. She had a little reaction on her lip and scared herself because she thought there was peanuts in my Enchilada entree. We asked our waiter and he went to the kitchen to make sure that there wasn't any in our orders. He reassured us that everything was safe. Turned out that she didn't get a reaction to peanuts. 

My enchilada was very spicy and her lips ended up feeling tingly from it and it scared her. But, the waiter was very nice in reassuring her that the food was safe. Service was very friendly, though. Will return to try other items when in the area.
