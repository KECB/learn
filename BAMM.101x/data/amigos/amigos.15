wo stars for Amigos : ( 

I'm here in NYC visiting friends for a couple of days . My best friends works in Columbia university area so we decided to have lunch there ! The famous Tom's restaurant was packed so we chose Amigos ! They had happy hour & of course lunch specials .

Sitting at the bar ... We were overlooked several times by the bartender . He finally came over & dropped off menus & Walked off ... *welcome to New York * lol . Moments like that I wish southern charm & manners ! He eventually came back & asked if we wanted drinks . Water first then we ordered margaritas. They were on special for $5. The size was very small . The quality of the tequila was very much a cheaper option . Ehhh could have passed on that . 

On to food ... I ordered the quesadilla special , it came with rice & beans . We sat there for about 15 mins after ordering & no one brought us chips & salsa . We asked & his reply was " it's only for customers eating food but since I ordered food we could get some . " I read over the menu to see if that was in small print somewhere .My friends decided they would just nibble on chips until they figured out what they wanted . Owen , who was rude but hey , guess it's the NY thing, assumed my friend was fasting because she didn't order anything . *side eye * we asked for his name & we talked for a bit . He was very cranky because he normally doesn't work that shift & implied he makes more during breakfast lol . Sigh .... So that was the reason behind crappy service ???

My best friend raved about the service & this place prior to walking in . Her usual person wasn't there & she apologized for my experience . I didn't finish my food because the rice & beans seemed microwaved . You can't really mess up a quesadilla ... It was ehhhh ok . Overall, I wouldn't go back to Amigos unless it was the last option in the area . The drinks were subpar ... I left with a little buzz & the urge to eat something else . There's tons of other food options in the Colombia university area to try !
