Amigos is a nice little Mexican restaurant on the UWS, and conveniently located a block away from work. The first time I went there I had a quesadilla which was just blah. How can someone mess up a quesadilla you might ask? Same question I had. Needless to say, I hadn't gone back to Amigos in over a year. 

I recently went back with a group of coworkers for drinks and had a more pleasant experience. We went around 4pm on a Friday and the restaurant was pretty empty. I had a peach and a strawberry margarita on the rocks, which were about $5-6. While at first they didn't taste very strong, it definitely caught back up to me later. The strawberry tasted like any stars every margarita that you've ever had while the peach was actually pretty delicious. We also ordered the guacamole with pineapple and pomegranate and WOW. It was so delicious and the pineapple and pomegranate were the perfect touch. 

If you want cheap margaritas and amazing guac, check out Amigos.
