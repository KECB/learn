My cousin recommended i try this place out...she knows i love margaritas and burritos. I wasted no time paying Amigos a visit.  It's a really cute place, very spacious. i was somewhat surprised at how big it was. After being seated i was given the complimentary chip and salsa. The chips were warm what i feel is always an excellent touch. I started off with a coconut margarita and it came in a little mason jar. I was a little taken back because it was so small, maybe the size of the glass threw me off. None the less it was very taste, and i had 2 additional. I was craving nachos, but i ordered the fish tacos. The order came with 3 tacos and a side of rice and beans.The portion was a great size i couldn't finish it all. The tacos weren't anything to go cray about, but they were good for the most part. I'll def be back. It's a kool place to have dinner with friends are just grab a few drinks. The waiter was very attentive...i didn't have to flag him down for anything because he constantly checked on my table
and those surrounding
