Came here on a Thursday night with some friends for drinks and food. The place is okay, the decor is cute but the place is getting a bit withered down. The staff is really friendly. The only thing I didn't like is that every time we asked our waiter for something he kind of acted annoyed at times. I had a chicken quesadilla it was really good. I also had two frozen margaritas which were also very delicious but small in size.
