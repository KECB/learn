This is so far from the REAL Mexican food I'm used to in California. Fortunately, the service is very nice. I do enjoy the chips, just wish their salsa was spicier and more flavorful.

My girl loves the food and she's from California as well, I guess she must have been away for too long. Her favorite is the carnitas tacos.

We just had brunch there today and it was so-so. I had the chilaquiles... My friend loved his torta.
