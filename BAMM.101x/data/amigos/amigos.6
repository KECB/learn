One of the worst Mexican restaurants! I love Mexican food and this is very inferior. We live across the street so we keep coming hoping it improves only to be repeatedly disappointed.
They were good for a while when they first opened. It's popular with the students I suppose, which is why they still have a lease with Columbia. Today the chips were burnt. The Queso fundido with chorizo was mostly chorizo. The guacamole didn't taste like anything. The salsa is chopped tomatoes and not much else.
Plantains-only a few were ripe... it's hopeless!
