Do NOT go here if you're looking for good Mexican food, or good food period. Went here with a friend and ate one of the worst meals I've had in a really long time. The fish bowl we ordered tasted like diluted tequila with a splash of juice -- drank about 1/5 of it. The fajitas I ordered were bland, and what flavor the chicken did have tasted like it came straight from a can. Rice was overlooked and dry, beans were mushy and tasteless. Ate about 1/4 of my food, and my friend, who ordered fish tacos, ate about the same because her dish was so bad. Service was also mediocre...

To top that off, i got sick from what little I ate! Had a stomach bug for about 36 hours :(
