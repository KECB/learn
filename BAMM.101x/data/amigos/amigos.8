I was around the area and heard about the good drink and food specials so I decided to check this place out. There was no wait, which is always a plus.

My friend and I both had a frozen Mango Coronarita, which was inexpensive and strong as well. The service was a little slow, but I can make the exception because our waitress told us she just got employed the day before.

We had the guacamole chips and dip for an appetizer, which was pretty good. The best part about this place is that it has soooo many great food and drink specials-DAILY! Recommended for those who love unlimited drinks and sliders!
