My friend and I were starving and looking for a place with decently priced margaritas to celebrate the day before Cinco de Mayo. After stopping at a few places, we decided to take advantage of Amigos outdoor seating while we still could (we got to the restaurant at around 5pm). The outdoor tables get good sunlight in the afternoon and evening so we were very comfortable in the 60-something degree weather.
Our first happy surprise was our free 6 ounce margaritas we got for checking in on Foursquare. I am usually not a huge fan of frozen margs, but these were excellent and very strong, and the (optional) mango flavoring was a nice addition. Yeah, they're small but they are only $5 (all day, except 11-1pm when they are $3!). I got the larger version later for $10 which is more than double the size of the small version. Before we even had a chance to order drinks, we were brought a basket of chips and chunky slsa, which was excellent and very flavorful.
My friend and I were starving but were planning on drinking and dining for a few hours, so after we started off with the nachos topped with chorizo ($15). The nachos were HUGE and were almost too much for the both of us, but we manned (and womaned) up and finished the plate. There was no way we were going to eat anything else, so we just hung out outside for a while. 
I ended up calling a couple other friends to join us, and we moved inside after it got chilly. My friend and I moved onto Bull Dogs (margaritas with an upside down coronita stuck inside), which ended up being a great decision. They were tasty and definitely not a bad deal at $10. My other friend split a fish bowl for $19 and while it was good, the jury is still out as to whether or not there was actually alcohol in it.
All in all the drinks and food were good and it was a fun atmosphere. I could definitely see myself coming back for drinks at the bar with a girl friend, and I am already trying to wrangle up friends for brunch.
I  would have ordered another drink (we were there for about 6 hours) but the waitress never came back and by that time we were ready to go. Despite the slow service, the manager was very nice and friendly and checked up on up multiple times. Additionally, the manager ended up comping 2 small and 2 large margaritas at our table, instead of the 4 small margaritas we got from the Foursquare deal which was really nice and saved us $10.
Ask for Angela! She is awesome!
I will definitely be going back!
