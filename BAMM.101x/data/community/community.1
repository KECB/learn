I ate here Monday night for a working dinner with a coworker. I immediately saw its reason for name, beyond the owner's fandom of the show of the same name: the tablet setup are nearly all communal long tables. There're rather few non-shared tables which is fine as not only is NYC filled with such setup but there's a liveliness in the Columbia area vibe which prefers this setup. There's a shortage of such nice sit-down restaurants in the Columbia area so this place is not only capitalizing on its presence but doing so with great style and flare.

I ordered the beef burger which was very juicy, perfectly lean, well sauced, cooked as desired (medium-well, for those who wonder), and paired with a dill pickle, a handmade cole slaw that lacked mayo (which is good as mayo's pure trans-fat), and a spindle of fries. My coworker got the salmon sandwich, same review applies.

Awesome bar alongside, but we didn't patronize it. Vast amounts of seating and an open kitchen where tons of food is prepared live makes for a fun environ.

I accidentally left my headphones, called to ask if it was found, and fetched them the day later. The staff were so helpful, kind, and soft-spoken about recovering and returning it that I'm duly humbled. Thanks, all!
