This is such a good brunch spot! The food, service & ambiance was exactly what we were looking for. We sat at an adorable table on the outdoor patio and our waiter (sadly forgot his name) was awesome.

I started with a raspberry iced tea & ordered the community custom egg white omelette with saut√©ed spinach & mushrooms and a side of smoked salmon. The omelette was thin (I would ask for eggs more well done next time) and was jam packed with veggies. The mushrooms were perfectly cooked. The salmon was so fresh and delicious. 

My friend got the house smoked salmon plate. He loved it! I used some of the chive cream cheese on the toast that came with the eggs - highly recommend asking for some on the side! 

We also shared & loved the fruit salad. We were pleasantly surprised by how big it was and the fruit was all very fresh. 

Overall, great brunch & highly recommend for a lovely brunch! Such a cute neighborhood spot and perfect for a pre-park brunch.
