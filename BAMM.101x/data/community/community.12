This place is great for Brunch. I went with my mom and my brother. Even though they were super busy, they were able to seat us right away, and our food came in a timely manner. The server was very friendly and sensitive to my dietary restrictions. 

The food was very fresh, and the chefs knew exactly what they were doing. I ordered the eggs benedict florentine. The hollandaise sauce was perfect: smooth and mildly tart. The biscuit under it was cooked to perfection. The eggs were perfect: solid on the outside, runny on the inside. However, the spinach although cooked well, kind of took away from the dish. It was difficult to cut along with everything else, and pulling the spinach out from under the uncut part made parts of the egg fall off the biscuit. Had the spinach been softer, this would have been more enjoyable to eat. Otherwise, it tasted delicious. 

My brother had the Huevos Rancheros. I wish I had ordered that instead. It was delicious. His eggs were sunny side up, and perfectly runny. The beans were seasoned perfectly, as was the rest of the tomato sauce, The tortilla was fresh and soft, and it came with delicious guacamole and sour cream. 

My mother ordered the frittata, which was also very good. As per her request, they put less goat cheese. The flavors blended very well together. The portobello mushrooms were cut into small enough pieces to fit in one bite, but were soft enough to cut further if they were too big for you. The frittata itself was soft and fluffy without being undercooked. 

Their coffee is from Brooklyn Roasting Company. I don't normally drink coffee, but I would have had a whole cup of it had I not ordered the hot chocolate, which was also delicious. The hot chocolate was made with real cocoa powder and milk. 

I gave this place four stars instead of five because of the consistency of the spinach in the eggs benedict florentine. Otherwise, I'd have given this place five stars.
