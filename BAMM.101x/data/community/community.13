Veggie sandwich on gluten free bread here. Nom nommmm. The veggies were perfect and fresh! 

Unfortunately, the GF bread is an upcharge for a sandwich half the size of the normal sandwich. Still delicious, but sad when you see your non-GF friend with a full size sandwich. I wish I took a picture, but I dug right in due to brunch hunger and slow service. 

I'd come back again, but be sure to have a snack before if you are feeling at all hungry like me.
