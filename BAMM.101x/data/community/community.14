I came here on a Saturday morning with one of my friends without a reservation around 10:30 am and luckily we were seated outside right away. A man came over to the table and filled our waters but didn't introduce himself as our waiter so I wasn't sure if he was the busboy or the waiter; regardless, he took our drink order. I ordered a mimosa, which was pretty good, and my friend ordered a coffee which was served in a huge mug. We both then ordered the breakfast biscuit. I was not a big fan of the sausage that was served with it and would much more have preferred bacon but overall it was good. And the carrot hash browns were yummy too! They were mostly made of potato with hints of carrots, so it wasn't too carroty. The bathrooms were also clean! My friend and I had a very good time.
