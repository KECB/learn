I've come here several times with a friend for brunch and once for dinner -- we've both really enjoyed a lot of the breakfast foods available; my favorite is the brioche French toast with blackberry and lemon curd & she loves heir waffles. Their maple butter sauce light, sweet and adds a nice taste as opposed to heavier syrups. If you come between 8-9am they have a pancake deal (blueberry or chocolate and a coffee or OJ for $12, not bad considering the area and average prices. Pancakes were fluffy and very filling) 

Their lattes sometimes taste a bit burnt and not mixed properly -- don't waste your money. 

Dinner looked pretty...and that was all. Overpriced small portions that were essentially inedible.
