Dinner on Tuesday, usually a quiet affair, but given that Community is one of few good spots on Broadway for a good sit down, even at 6:30 p.m. it was bumping. I work at CU, and may be one of the few people that's never been to Community before. 

Nice little tip, they have a deal between 5 pm and 7 pm on weekdays - beef burger and beer for $16. To note - any revisions/additions to your order is $2. Let's be honest, sometimes a man just wants some sweet sweet avocado in the cool winter months. Nice little draft selection, I went for the Fire Island Beer Co. Lighthouse - nice and crisp and not hoppy - a rare breed in NYC. 

Our waiter Sam D. was the perfect level of attentive, there for a question and to fill our water glasses, I don't think my ever dipped below half-filled. All and all a solid meal, the burger was a wee bit dry, but cooked to my specifications (medium rare). I'd be interested to check out their lunch, which alas is usually a crush of CU staff and students, but there's always summer break ...
