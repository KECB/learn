Came here for brunch with my wife after she found the good review, and it did not disappoint! 

We did have to wait to be seated (which is a good sign even though no one really wants to)...

The food is awesome! Very fresh, clean, and NOT oily, which is my usually qualm.

Disclaimer: I like diner food but it is almost always to greasy which I hate, but this place has very fresh and carefully prepared food. 

I wanted to order everything off the menu, but settled on the juevos rancheros with side of carrot hash browns, and biscuit. My wife got the blueberry pancakes. Everything was awesome. The hash browns were not the least bit greasy; the pancakes were delicious, and I really enjoyed the juevos (w/ chorizo).

I also tried my first ever bloody mary, and it was really good. 

Will definitely be back!
