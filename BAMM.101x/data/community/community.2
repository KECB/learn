Service is great - our water was also filled, our coffee was replenished at appropriate times. The attention to the details of the flavors in the food is impeccable. The accompanying sauces and jams were so memorable and delicious! 

Initially, we went for brunch in the early afternoon, but ended up staying for appetizers and split a bottle of wine.  The staff did not make us feel guilty at all, but welcomed us to stay until their dinner hour started. During the whole time, not one waiter came over to encourage us to pay our bill and leave. Instead, they filled our coffees and water. Speaking of coffee - their black drip coffee from a roaster in Brooklyn is delicious! Down to the last drop - it was smooth, nutty, and not bitter even cold. 

Details of the food, including the presentation of each dish. The biscuit sandwich was healthy-ish as they utilized whole wheat flour. The sausage was not fatty at all and the meat patty - although a little smaller when compared to the biscuit (meat:bread ratio) was small, it went was so tasty with the tomato jam, as well as the perfectly cooked eggs!  The raspberry preserve was so fresh! Not overly sweet and definitely enjoyed the seeds within the preserve.  The 7 grain waffle with the fresh berries, butterscotch sauce (maple glaze?) with FRESH whipped cream was THE BEST dish there.  There was a raspberry sauce beautifully spread on the plate that added a nice tartness to the whole bite. Pancakes were fluffy and they used real, non-frozen blueberries which I loved!  The sauce that came with it was definitely different than the waffle glaze, so it was so tasty to discover the flavors within the glaze. 

Community is definitely one of my favorite, non-boozy brunch spots in the UWS/Morningside! Will go back!
