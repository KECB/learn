Traveled up here from the upper east side to get away from the usual brunch places. Only a 20 minute bus ride from 79th, very easy to get to. Came on Sunday near 1pm and it was VERY busy, ended up waiting an hour and a half (1 hour more than we were told) however, the food was ah-mazing. Everything looks and sounds good and this place smells like heaven. I had the special of 2 fried eggs, vegetable ragout, bacon and truffle vinaigrette and it was Delish. Cheaper brunch cocktails than most places (only $10....but yes, it is nyc where most are $14+) if I have one recommendation, it's the POTATO PANCAKES!!! SO GOOD, My bf and I split them. He had the pancakes and said they were the best he had in the city. Also GREAT FOR GLUTEN FREE! I am gluten/dairy intolerant and they were able to fully accommodate me. Also super close to Colombia's main campus, great place to walk around and digest.
