Community is a brunch place next to Columbia. I came here one day to meet up with my cousin who studies at Columbia. Seated around 10 mins on a cozy Sat morning, not too bad. The interior was normal, nothing fancy, but we enjoyed window seats and a tiny desk instead of the long family style tables at the center of the restaurant which gives limited privacy. I really like the hanging lights from the ceiling which is quite cute. The ground leveled glass windows allow you to see the views outside- it is a nice change from the busy pedestrians and giant high rise buildings view of the typical New York street cues in Midtown. Morningside feels more like a college town with older residential building and quieter streets. 
Despite the 3.5 stars I was pleasantly surprised at the food here. I thought it was delicious! Much better than my experience at Stephanie's at Newbury in Boston or even many of the brunch places I've been in LA. 
We ordered the morning specials : 7 grains waffle and truffle egg dish. 
-7 grains waffle: had vanilla cream, raspberry, cherry, and toasted nuts. Tasted slightly more chewy than the usual waffle with flour, and on top there was marinated peach slices and cream. I really like how it wasn't hard and overly sweet- especially how the toasted nuts added a level of crunchiness to the heaviness of the cream. 

- The truffle egg dish: had sausage, potatoes, some leafy greens, saut√©ed mushrooms, and poached egg on top. To be honest I  could not tasted the truffle at all, besides the garlic and the pepper and the salt; however with this mix it can hardly go wrong. It was flavorful and not overly salty. 

The only thing I guess I can "complain" is that the dishes were small. 
Bill came up to be around 50, which isn't exactly cheap considering how small the portions are- but justifiable still due to the taste.
