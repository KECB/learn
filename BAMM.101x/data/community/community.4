Overpriced, oversized, oversweet... Oh wait, this is America.

The pancakes with banana and walnut were okay. They could have done without the maple butter and walnuts and would have been better with maple syrup. I'd rather have paid half price for half the portion.

Bottomless coffee was standard.

The waitress serving our table was polite and courteous considering how many customers she was dealing with. 

Having seen the title of this place, I did expect somewhere a little cosier, trendier, more rustic and more inviting. The interior was a little canteenish and there were only a couple of juices on the menu. I wouldn't go back at these prices and with these crowds.
