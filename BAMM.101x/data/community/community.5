"I have a degree from Columbia, and now I have to get one from America." - Jeff Winger, Community.

I came here with my friend who also is a huge fan of the show "Community", which used to be aired on NBC then got cancelled and then re-birthed on Yahoo! Screen. That's right, Yahoo! Screen. 

Sigh, oh how I miss the golden age of that glorious, glorious show.

My friend, however, is actually pursuing a REAL degree from Columbia University--not Colombia the country, unlike our hateable yet lovable ex-lawyer who attended Greendale Community College.

She chose this place because of the name--I mean come on, can't get more fitting than that--and because of its proximity to Columbia's campus. Community Food & Juice is literally a few blocks away, so it's perfect for students.

On a nice New York morning, we had brunch and got to talk about everything from racist experiences to the TV show we can't quite get over. 

The food? My chocolate pancakes were pretty darn good and pretty darn rich. I don't know what I was expecting. In fact, the "syrup"--not even sure what it is (apple?) was kind of overkill because the pancakes and chocolate were far sweet enough.

I also got a shiso mojito which sounds fancy--and it better be for the $11 I paid for it. Flor de Cana aged white rum, fresh lime juice, shiso-mint simple syrup, yuzu splash, muddled mint, and crushed ice made up the drink that Jeff Winger would have called a "kid's drink".

It was pretty strong but the shiso-mint did come through, so it was worth it (I'm rationalizing the price right now).

All in all, a pleasant experience with nice service and nice company. It's not every day I get to go to New York, take some subways to meet a friend, eat some good food, get a tour of a top university, and walk away with my wallet much lighter.

On that note,

"It said market price.  What market are you shopping at!?!?!" - Troy Barnes

Man I love that show.
