Solid breakfast place in Morningside Heights.
I came here with a friend - we were seated promptly and service was attentive. The decor was beautiful and the lighting was warm - a great place for a brunch date. 

I ordered the Country Breakfast and the eggs were delicious and fluffy, the biscuit was moist and flavorful, the carrot hash browns were warm and comforting, and the ham was sweet and juicy. 

Pricing was around $15 per person, which was reasonable for the quality and amount of food, especially considering it's New York. The restaurant is within walking distance of Columbia, and I would recommend for a nice brunch in the area!
