I work in a restaurant a block away from The Heights and come here at least 4 times a week.  The staff are really lovely (and, incidentally, all of drinking age, NOT that it is at all relevant). 
Their margaritas are amazing value: Strong and available in five flavors AND ONLY $5 at happy hour. Taco Tuesday is awesome and the food is all around solid bar and grill offerings with a Mexican slant. 
As far as their seating policy,  I have trouble understanding the previous Yelper Mojdeh's' criticism... You cannot expect to go to any restaurant in the city and expect to take up a table just for drinks on a busy night, especially when there is perfectly good and adequate bar seating.  Unfortunately an inflated sense of entitlement abounds on the Columbia university campus.  Maybe a few months waiting tables, or a week in business school would change your mind about this being a crazy policy!
And as for AMIGOS being a better bet,  AMIGOS SUCKS in EVERY WAY except for their salsa.
