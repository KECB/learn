I came here about four years ago and I still remember the deliciousness of their food.  I ordered a cobb salad and it was so dang tasty.  They put a generous amount of chicken on top.  I also thought the restaurant was rather memorable because you go up the stairs onto this half room/open terrace setting.  We came during the summer so the weather was just perfect.  It was just the perfect restaurant for us to eat at because we got to eat good food and enjoy the fresh air.
