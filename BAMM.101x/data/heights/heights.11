It is hard to find rooftops uptown, and when you do they are not all good. This one, ROCKS. A great place for happy hour, daytime drinks, or late night fun. The prices are great for a Manhattan bar!! I was able to enjoy the night here with a big group of people and the staff was great at handling us! Defiantly a go to place if you are in the area !!!
