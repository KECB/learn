If you are a Columbia student in the Morningside area, you should definitely try this hidden gem, especially during lunch when they have a lunch special for $8.95 including soda!

Whenever I went here I always had the Chicken Penne (with pesto sauce), it is delicious!!!! This is definitely the dish I would dream of when I'm away from NYC. My family had their salmon, their burger and an appetizer (which I think were Nachos), and they all looked very good and tasty! The portion sizes are humongous!!!

The only downside of this place is that it takes FOREVER to get your dish. If you plan on having lunch here, try to come at least 40 minutes prior to your planned activity and try to order asap, otherwise it will take too long to get the check.
