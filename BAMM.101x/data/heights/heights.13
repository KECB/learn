A Morningside Heights institution.  During the academic year, it is definitely a Columbia bar, but during the summer, it is an "everyone" bar.  I came her for the first time in 2001 (different world- a few months before 9/11) and it was my birthday.  A sultry summer night in June.  And even when I didn't live in this neighborhood, I kept coming here in the summer. 

I hope to return here again soon.  I've been nostalgic.
