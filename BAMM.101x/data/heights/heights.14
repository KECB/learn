For $18+ an entree, you get the worst food in a one mile radius.  Tasteless expensive tacos, weak chili, and $13 taco salads that don't include any protein to go with mediocre atmosphere.  For the $75 dinner for two with one drink each, try any of the more interesting French or Korean joints down the road.
