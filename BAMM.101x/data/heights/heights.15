I came here on a Sunday night as a group of 6, no reservation. We sat at a table for drinks and had a very good time (although you have to leave the table and get your own drinks at the bar). Drinks were $10 on average; not bad. The music was great (a bit of everything and I mean everything) & the bartender was friendly. The mojitos, wings and fries were delicious. 
I will be back!
