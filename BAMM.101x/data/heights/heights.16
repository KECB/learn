1. (-1 star) Happy hour just isn't that happy - the place is packed, you're in the way no matter where you stand, and you can't sit unless you eat. 

2. (+1 star) Mojitos are yummy and are so strong that they count as 2 drinks in one. Too bad I was told that my mojito was the last mojito, as they'd run out of ingredients (!?!).

3. (-1 star) The "guac" (fondly abbreviated on the menu) is missing: cilantro, lime, and salt. Hullo.

4. While the rooftop patio is lovely, the food is only so-so. Soooooo, it may not be worth waiting on the line, which is by the door, which is by the kitchen, which has a swinging door that may or may not knock you in the face, which is by the stinky bathrooms, which winds all the way down the concrete stairs that you should not be near after drinking a 2-drinks-in-1 mojito.
