Eh, this place is ok.  I walked past this place a million times.  Went in once.  Once.  Upstairs there were drink specials, I think it was like $6 for a frozen marg.  Whatever.  Trust me guys, go to Havana Central for your drinks.  Must better, and this place I guess I'm too old for.  College hang out for sure, esp the top floor.
