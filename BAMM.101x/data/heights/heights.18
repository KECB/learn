I used to love this place.  Not super expensive and the most amazing taco salad.  They were damaged by the fire next door so I was very excited to come here when they reopened.  New menu, without the great wings specials and my taco salad was taken off completely. terribly higher prices and the food was subpar.  Also...  Found a hair in my food.  Our waitress was great.  The only saving grace.
