This was a place me and my friends passed tonight. We wanted good drinks and good food and we found just that! We saw it and walked in not knowing to expect!

Everything on the menu looked delicious! The waitress was very nice and we had a wonderful girls night!

We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share which is pictured. Vancouver fries (fries in jack and American cheese with a side of gravy. The Americanized pouting), spiked tenders (buffalo sauce and jalape√±os), nachos, and fried calamari. 

DELICIOUS!!

My friends also ordered the passion fruit and strawberry margaritas which were very good. And for me just a simple bud light. Overall it was great and we will definitely be going back!

For anyone near Columbia or the heights it's definitely a place to visit!
