I was so surprised to find there was a place with an open rooftop in this area! Really comfortable location with a bar up there too.

They have delicious and strong martinis for just $5. You have tons of options for flavors too. I got the strawberry mango and had no regrets. I will definitely try their other flavors next time! They also have surprisingly good salsa and chips for just $3. Perfect combo with the martini! Grab a friend, chat, and enjoy the view and fresh air up there!
