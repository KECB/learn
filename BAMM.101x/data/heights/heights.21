Tonight was the first time I went to the Heights Bar, The atmosphere was very college like, the music was a little loud, since we wanted to chat and eat at the same time without screaming at each other. We tried to go to the roof top deck but it was packed,  so we ate in the regular eating area. I had a burger and salad with the house dressing. The burger was cooked perfectly cooked and had a great  flavor throughout (the bun was toasted too.)  The salad was a good size portion and the house dressing was really good too. The entire wait staff was super friendly and when we asked for a sample taste of the sangria, the gladly made a fresh taste batch. 
I highly recommend this place the food and drinks not only tasted good, they were reasonably priced. I will definitely go back.
