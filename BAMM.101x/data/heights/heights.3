The heights Bar and Grill is literally around the corner from my job, legit same block and everything. However, my work schedule has only allowed me to visit 2-3 times, and I've ordered to-go lunch twice. 

It's a cool, very chill bar with a rooftop which is amazing for summer time. They also have happy hour during the day and then again late at night. The first 2-3 times I went to Heights, I sat at the bar with a friend and had drinks and appetizers. Because I was at the bar, and both times were pretty early about 4:40pm, service was pretty quick and the bartender was very attentive. The frozen margaritas were delicious, from what I remember (Take that as you will). The San Fransisco wings are HANDS DOWN the single item that will keep me coming back. It's like a honey mustard-buffalo sauce fusion happening all at once! The wings were crispy with just the right amount of sauce! I have also ordered the turkey burger with fries for lunch and they told me 10 minutes, so I waited 10 minutes, walked over, and still waited about 10 minutes when I arrived! The other time I ordered to go, the wings were good but fries were soggy. 

Overall, I definitely recommend this spot if you are in the mood for cheap drinks, meeting with friends to grab a quick bite, or most importantly, to feast on my beloved San Fransisco wings!
