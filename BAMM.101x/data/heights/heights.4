Their Happy hour is amazing it's like it's always going on !! But I tried their food and ordered the chicken tacos, the tacos themselves were not too bad however the rice and beans accompanying them... The rice was cold I didn't understand why and the beans looked like they didn't belong. 

Besides their ever lasting happy hour this place doesn't have much going on.
