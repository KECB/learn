The Heights is a bar on Upper West Side. Take the 1 train to 110th street stop or 2/3 express train to 96th street stop and walk a few blocks.

The bar takes up two floors, the top floor being the rooftop. The main floor has tall ceilings, tables for those eating and a bar that seats a dozen or so people. Tables are reserved for those who are ordering food. We sat at the bar because we wanted drinks only. The bartender, Raul, is incredibly nice and personable. He brought fresh blueberries and ginger, so he was creating some really summer cocktails that weren't on the menu. There are two TVs and they were nice about changing the channel for us. The rooftop (opens at 4pm) was too hot, so I'd recommend going after the sunsets.
