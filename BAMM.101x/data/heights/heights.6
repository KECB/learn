Up above it all (until 11pm when the roof deck closes) is what it should say on their sign. I'm assuming it must be some permitting or ordinance issue, but it's really a bummer that right when a fun summer evening is kicking off on the roof, it closes down and everyone is corralled back down into the crowded bar. I will say that the late night (11pm-2am) happy hour is great--$6 frozen margs and they are potent. This is a Columbia bar so be prepared for lots of very drunk college students (I'm looking at you, girl who thought her Columbia ID would be good enough to get into the bar), but that's part of what makes it a good time!
