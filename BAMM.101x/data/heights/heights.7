This has been one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood for years. Always good food and great frozen margaritas.
I was disappointed to go there last night with friends to find a new menu, with fewer food options particularly vegetarian options. Our favorites are no longer available.
We won't be going back to eat unless someone rethinks this new menu. Bad idea.
