I went there for dinner on Sunday with 2 friends. I give 5 star because everything was perfect from the moment we walked in, we were greeted by the host and since it wasn't crowded we had a choice to either sit on the second floor or the roof top. We chose second floor by the big window. 
They had happy hour for frozen flavored margaritas $6 yay. We ordered the chicken pesto sandwich with fries, regular burger and pulled pork tacos. The grilled basil chicken sandwich is A MUST! my tacos were ok, i expected a pulled pork but it was more like chunks of pork but still good. 
The waiter was quick and checked twice if everything was ok. They also kept checking if the water was refilled as well. 
Also they played good music, overall a very good experience, i will def come back and recommend.
