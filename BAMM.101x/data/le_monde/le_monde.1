My wife and I get food from here whenever we're in town. I have relatives who live just a few blocks away. 

I've never had a bad experience here. Service is always great food is always wonderful. The most recent time my wife got the duck confit (sp?) And I had the rack of lamb. Both were absolutely amazing and if I weren't sitting by the window I'd have likely licked the plate clean. 

We've never been there for anything but dinner so my review can't speak to their brunch.
