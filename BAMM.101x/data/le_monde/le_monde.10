Horrible service, horrible food. Summing it up for you quickly if you are debating if you should drop in for a bite to eat. 

I think they take forever to take your order, and deliver the food because they want you to sit in here as long as possible to make their business look busy. I caught on, yes. 

My food was cold, so I needed to send it back. Although they tried to accommodate, I felt that I was given a slight attitude when I was asked if everything was ok. Perhaps it was cultural. 

Our orders took a VERY LONG TIME. Caesar salad tasted very fishy. Perhaps too much anchovies in the dressing? 

One of our wait staff was drunk. 

Bottom of my salmon was burned. Mashed Potatoes were very bland. Considering my dish was $25, I expected a lot. 

PROS:
Superb chocolate mouse. 
Decent Brussel sprouts
