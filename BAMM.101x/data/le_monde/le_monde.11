This is a weekly-go to place for me and my husband. 
--Best French fries I've ever had! For some reason, they usually do better job for dinner!
I ordered once for brunch and it's a little disappointed.
--Like the pre-fix dinner menu! Great selections of dishes, a lot of food but won't break the bank!
--Great wine selection! Love the margarita!
