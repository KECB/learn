I'm not even joking when I say that this place has the best buttermilk pancakes I've had to date. They are perfectly fluffy and thick each time. Sometimes they're absolutely ENORMOUS, I guess it depends on who's in the kitchen that day ;p. The only other thing I've had here is called shakshuka or something and that was good too--its baked eggs with pesto, tomato sauce, Parmesan, and some bread. I will say that my dad did NOT enjoy the steak frites, as he noted that the steak seemed low quality. The breakfast croissant sandwich and croque monsieur look delicious!
