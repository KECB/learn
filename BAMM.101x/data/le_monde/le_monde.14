This place is obviously busy and for a Saturday brunch you would think they would schedule staff accordingly. It took a half hour to even get someone to take a drink order once we were seated. Then an hour passed by until we were served. Food was good, my girl got fettuccine alfredo and I had the stuffed French toast. I would give them a better review because the food was good but the waiting really was long.
