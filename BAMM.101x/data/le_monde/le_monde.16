Impeccable food. Awful service (went on Valentines Day, that may have been the problem).

The free bread they bring you is thick-cut and whole wheat. Yum. The butter was rock hard. I needed a chisel.

Waiting, waiting, for the menu.

We asked for a bottle of sparkling water. After 10 minutes, someone else asked us what we wanted to drink. Water. After another 10 minutes I asked a busboy who was assisting for our waiter to bring us water. The heck?

We finally got the menu and I ordered the bouillabaisse. The fish was fresh and perfectly cooked. The broth was excellent and rich--worth dipping your bread into.

She ordered the coq au vin. Oh so delicious. Such a rich flavor.

We asked for a custom order of truffle fries--why not? He said sure and would confirm it with the chef. He never came back.

After the meal, we ordered desert. The crowd was starting to die down and I figured service would be quick. She ordered the lemon tart and I ordered some berry custard something. He said my custard would be right out since it was already made for the Prix Fixe menu.

Surprise, my custard never showed. Her lemon tart did.

It took at least half an hour for us to receive the check, provide the card and get it back to sign. Sigh...

I'll try it one more time because I love duck confit and I'd like to try theirs.
