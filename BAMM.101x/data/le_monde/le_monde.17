We came in for dessert.

We asked about a few desserts and the manager was quite a jerk in his reply. He had a condescending tone when I asked about the drinks and wanted my drink a certain way. 

Was this treatment cause we weren't eating dinner? 
We ordered and decided to walk out cause we didn't need to be talked down to and felt bad cause we didn't want to burden him with questions. Why should a customer be felt bad and talked down to? 

No thank you.
The man what we assume is the manager was awful, the large burly man. 

One star. We should've known to look for another place when the establishment isn't full during dinner on a Saturday night. Keep walking people, skip this place and go a block down for better service.
