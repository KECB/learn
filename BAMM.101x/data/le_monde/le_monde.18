It's the sort of French restaurant that you sadly don't see enough of anymore.

DÃ©cor is classic brasserie; menu is too. I had the duck confit and would recommend. I've also been there for the tapas, which was very nice (I think on Thursday nights?). Service prompt and friendly.

Just a tad pricey, but hey. It's French.

Take your mother there.
