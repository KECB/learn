pretty good food for the area. i would recommend going for brunch over any other meal, as everything i've ordered for brunch has been quite good

the shakshuka is great, and you can't anything else like it in the area. the eggs should be a little runnier, but it's a minor complaint, since the rest of it is so good.

average benedict, but still pretty good. the french toasts and pancakes are very solid, but a little pricey for what you get. i would recommend the stuffed french toast in this category.

the lobster florentine is great as well, and plated well. i would recommend this dish if you're looking for something unique to get at this restaurant

ambience is great, and service is quick and attentive (without being annoying). laid-back atmosphere
