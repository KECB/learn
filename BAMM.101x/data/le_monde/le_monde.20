This is a coZy UWS neighborhood place with major French accent and very good bistro fare.  No, it's not La Grenouille but delicious things like steak frites, escargot, onion soup, and various excellent fish dishes.  The menu touts a good deal of organic and local veggies and to my notice the dishes are  well executed with some flair but simplistically.   Nice little wine selection, reasonable (but the pours are a bit stingy) ...   very friendly and professional staff up front, handled reservations well. Servers that I had are a bit slow and maybe inattentive, bit of attitude too but nothing offensive.  I like it here. Been here several times and will return.
