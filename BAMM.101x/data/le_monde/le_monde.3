Hubbs and I came here while we were waiting for my son to finish he course in the area, at Columbia. He had a whole semester there, with classes every Saturday, so we decided to try out a different restaurant in the area every week during that time. Yelp was definitely instrumental in our plan and after searching for a restaurant nearby, we cam across Le Monde. I think this was one of the first restaurants we tried. 

For October, it was unusually warm and when we arrived at the restaurant, there was a long wait for indoor seating so we just grabbed a table outside and let the staff know we were seated. The service was good. Our server came and greeted us within minutes of sitting down and gave some good menu suggestions. 

I love warm alcoholic drinks, like hot toddies, and they offer a Hot Buttered Rum which we both had to try. It was the perfect drink that day since there was still a chill in the air. I also tried a GUS (grown up soda) which tasted really good; I hadn't had one before and it tasted light mixed drink. 

As for the food, I went with the Veggie Frittata and a side of Turkey Chorizo. I loved the frittata; I was full because of the portion size and had to take half to go. The chorizo, however, was not my favourite. They were like spicy dry meat pucks. I love having non-pork options for meat sides and I commend Le Monde for making those in-house but they just didn't taste that great to me. Hubby had the Breakfast Biscuit w/Chicken Apple Rosemary Sausage and he had the same issue with his sausage; it was a great alternative to bacon but the flavour was off. The biscuit, on the other hand, he polished off. 

On this particular day, we enjoyed brunch AND a show. I am unsure of the event but we watched hundreds of skateboarders flying down the street with police escorts. It was pretty amazing. In that area, they also have a weekly fair during better weather seasons, featuring many different food stalls. It's a nice area to visit and walk around. 

I would love to try them out for dinner, as I said, the service was great and we were checked on regularly.
