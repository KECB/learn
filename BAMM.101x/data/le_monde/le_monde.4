Discovered this place by chance while searching for a brunch place. 

Both the ambience and food was good. We had ordered the french onion soup, lobster florentine, and the shrimp quinoa salad. My favorite was definitely the quinoa salad, because not only was it fresh and delicious, it was presented very nicely as well. I really enjoyed the soup too. My favorite part it was definitely the cheese, because it was so crisp! 

This place is worth checking out.
