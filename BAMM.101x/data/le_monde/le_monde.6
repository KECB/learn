My heart was set on brunch from the beginning of the week, and my friend was totally on board.  We decided to give this a try because I am a total sucker for fresh French coffee.  We walked right in at about 10AM, and were seated at a window seat.  The table for two was a little small; think of a bistro or cafe table.  I think for the size of the plates, it would have been easier to juggle and manage the space.

I ordered the Scandinavie, which was two English muffins over smoked salmon and poached eggs covered in hollandaise sauce, set with a side of their home fries.  Everything was cooked very nicely, and tasted pretty fresh and warm.  My friend got the country platter, and had his scrambled eggs over a nest of hash browns.  Again, he was very pleased.

Did this place really stick out as being something to remember?  Not really.
Did we get good service? Yes, they were attentive and refilled our water and coffee multiple times.
Would I come back if I was in the area? Definitely - good food and good service make a returning customer.
