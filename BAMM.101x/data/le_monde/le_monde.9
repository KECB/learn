5 stars for the amazing Molly Ringwald look alike behind the bar who makes a killer mimosa. How does one make a killer mimosa, you ask? Easy. With way more champagne than OJ! Anyway, the bartender had really great energy. I would come back here just for drinks because I like the vibe, and most likely only at night. 

The food left me unsatisfied. The presentation of the food itself was flawless, but the flavors were missing. They were a bit off to me. 

I'd probably come back to try a steak dinner instead of the brunch. When you've had Crepes from Pates Et Traditions in Williamsburgh, it's hard to find anything that can match.
